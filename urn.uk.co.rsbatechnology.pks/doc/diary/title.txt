=Diary Of First Steps With NetKernel=

This book records the experience of building my first real-world application in NetKernel.

It shows the steps I went through as I tried to build a Position Keeping Server module, documenting any questions, issues and insights I gained along the way.

==Background==

I am an independent consulting business analyst and project manager, working in the investment banking industry for over 20 years.  Over the past decade, I have specialised in working on FX e-commerce front-office trading platforms.  I have been responsible for project management, business analysis, architecture, functional design, Java development and extensive manual and automated testing activities.

I was first introduced to Peter Rogers, Tony Butterworth, NetKernel and 1060Research in March 2014 via [[www.gilb.com | Tom Gilb]].  I was immediately intrigued by the possibilities of Resource-Orientated Computing and resolved to learn more about its capabilities and qualities.

After progressing through a number of the excellent tutorials and videos, I wanted to see how far I can get working on a an application loosely based on a recent real-world application I have worked on.  To help me remember what I have learnt along the way, I also decided to write up my experiences as I progressed in the form of this diary.  

==The Diary==

The diary is presented as a multi-part documentation book embedded in the [[Position Keeping Module | PKS]] module, in order to keep everything related to PKS under one convenient project.
